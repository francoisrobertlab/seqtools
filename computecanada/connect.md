# Connecting to Compute Canada server

:memo: The examples use Beluga server

```
ssh beluga.computecanada.ca
module load seqtools
cd scratch
ls
cd $dataset_name
```

`$dataset_name` is the folder containing the dataset files to be analyzed

The `ls` command is optional, but will help you find the dataset folder

## Notes

Commands should be executed in a terminal window

On Mac and Linux, open a terminal - [Open Mac Terminal](https://support.apple.com/en-ca/guide/terminal/apd5265185d-f365-44cb-8b09-71a064a42125/mac)

On Windows 10, [open a PowerShell terminal](https://www.howtogeek.com/662611/9-ways-to-open-powershell-in-windows-10/)

On older Windows versions, install [Putty](https://www.putty.org) and use Putty as a replacement for the first `ssh` command
